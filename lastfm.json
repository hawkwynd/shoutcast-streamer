They were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on September 17, 2013. Their ninth album, Remedy, released in 2014, won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album. The group's music has been called old-time, folk, and alternative country. Along with original songs, the band performs many pre-World War II blues and folk songs.\r\n\r\nBluegrass musician Doc Watson discovered the band while its members were busking outside a pharmacy in Boone, North Carolina, in 2000. With an old-time string sound fueled by punk rock energy, it has influenced acts like Mumford \u0026 Sons and contributed to a revival of banjo-picking string bands playing Americana music — leading to variations on it.\r\n\r\nThe group released their sixth studio album, Volunteer, through Columbia Nashville on April 20, 2018 — coinciding with their 20th anniversary as a group. They released 50 Years of Blonde on Blonde on April 28, 2017 (their first album on Columbia Nashville). Previous studio albums were O.C.M.S. (2004), Big Iron World (2006), Tennessee Pusher (2008), Carry Me Back (2012), and Remedy (2014). Their song \"Wagon Wheel\", written by frontman Ketch Secor through a co-authoring arrangement with Bob Dylan, was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in April 2013 and has been covered by a number of acts, including Darius Rucker, who made the song a top 40 hit.\r\n\r\n","track-duration":"186000","track-name":"James River Blues"}

The band was re-christened \"American Ram Jam\" for the UK market to avoid confusion with a UK band with the same name.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, the album was reissued on CD as Golden Classics with a bonus track, \"I Should Have Known\", which was originally the B-side to the \"Black Betty\" single.","track-duration":"236000","track-name":"Black Betty"}

Of the current lineup, Box is the only remaining original member. Throughout many lineup changes, the band has included many notable musicians, such as vocalists David Byron, John Lawton, John Sloman, Peter Goalby and Steff Fontaine, bassists Gary Thain, Trevor Bolder, John Wetton, Bob Daisley and John Jowitt, drummers Nigel Olsson, Lee Kerslake and Chris Slade, and keyboardists Ken Hensley and John Sinclair.\u003cbr/\u003e\r\nThis is the album that solidified Uriah Heep's reputation as a master of gothic-inflected heavy metal. From short, sharp rock songs to lengthy, musically dense epics, Demons and Wizards finds Uriah Heep covering all the bases with style and power. The album's approach is set with its lead-off track, \"The Wizard\": it starts as a simple acoustic tune but soon builds into a stately rocker that surges forth on a Wall of Sound built from thick guitar riffs, churchy organ, and operatic vocal harmonies.

After the release of their previous album, Moving Pictures, the band started to prepare material for a follow-up during soundchecks on their 1981 concert tour and during the mixing of their subsequent live album Exit...Stage Left. Signals demonstrates the group continuing with the use of synthesizers, sequencers, and other electronic instrumentation. It is their last album produced by their longtime associate Terry Brown, who had worked with them since 1974.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\r\nThe album peaked at No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In November 1982, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the United States. Rush released five singles from the album: \"New World Man\", which became their highest charting single in the United States, \"Subdivisions\", \"The Analog Kid\", \"The Weapon\", and \"Countdown\". The group supported Signals with a concert tour from April 1982 to May 1983. Signals has been reissued several times, including a remaster with a new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mix in 2011.\r\n\u003c/p\u003e","track-duration":"334000","track-name":"Subdivisions"}

They were among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and his erratic stage persona, and the group was widely regarded as representative of the era's counterculture.\r\n\r\nThe band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself a reference to a quote by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records, the Doors released eight albums in five years, some of which are considered among greatest of all time, including The Doors (1967), Strange Days (1967), and L.A. Woman (1971). By 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.\r\n\r\nMorrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. They released three more albums in the 1970s, two of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as the Doors of the 21st Century. Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek–Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs. According to the RIAA, they have sold 33 million records in the US and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","track-duration":"210000","track-name":"Back Door Man"}

As the decade progressed the Jazz Crusaders moved from a more bop-oriented sound and began to incorporate more soul and R\u0026B influences.\r\n\r\nIn 1971 the band shortened its name to The Crusaders, which made sense seeing as they were playing much more funk than jazz. The core group of Sample, Felder, Hooper, and Henderson remained and they added guitarists Larry Carlton and bassist Robert \"Pops\" Popwell. Henderson left the Crusaders in 1975, with Hooper leaving in 1983.\r\n\r\nHenderson subsequently revived the \"Jazz Crusaders\" moniker (over Sample's objections) for 1995's Happy Again, and was joined by Wilton Felder and Larry Carlton. This new group (officially known as \"Wayne Henderson's Jazz Crusaders\") released a series of recordings in the late 1990s, but the music bore little resemblance to the acoustic, hard bop style of the original group. In 2003, Sample, Felder, and Hooper revived The Crusaders.","track-duration":"330000","track-name":"Soul Caravan"}

The band consisted of singer Ian Curtis, guitarist and keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris.\r\n\r\nSumner and Hook formed the band after attending a Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they soon developed a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP An Ideal for Living drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album Unknown Pleasures, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979.\r\n\r\nCurtis suffered from personal problems including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He committed suicide on the eve of the band's first American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, Closer, was released two months later; it and single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became their highest charting releases.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members regrouped under the name New Order. They were successful throughout the next decade, blending post-punk with electronic and dance music influences.","track-duration":"203000","track-name":"Love Will Tear Us Apart"}

These members had played together since 1959, first as The Blue Velvets and later as The Golliwogs. Their musical style encompassed roots rock, swamp rock, and blues rock. They played in a Southern rock style, despite their San Francisco Bay Area origin, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River, and other popular elements of Southern United States iconography, as well as political and socially conscious lyrics about topics including the Vietnam War. The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Upstate New York.\r\n\r\nThe group disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had officially left the previous year, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in subsequent lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's ongoing disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz created further protracted court battles, and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at CCR's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","track-duration":"250000","track-name":"The Midnight Special"}

His 1986 album, So, is his best-selling release and is certified triple platinum in the UK and five times platinum in the U.S. The album's most successful single, \"Sledgehammer\", won a record nine MTV Awards at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards and, according to a report in 2011, it was MTV's most played music video of all time.\r\n\r\nGabriel has been a champion of world music for much of his career. He co-founded the WOMAD festival in 1982. He has continued to focus on producing and promoting world music through his Real World Records label. He has also pioneered digital distribution methods for music, co-founding OD2, one of the first online music download services. Gabriel has also been involved in numerous humanitarian efforts. In 1980, he released the anti-apartheid single \"Biko\". He has participated in several human rights benefit concerts, including Amnesty International's Human Rights Now! tour in 1988, and co-founded the Witness human rights organisation in 1992.

Their most popular songs include \"Romantic Traffic\", \"Nova Heart\", \"Old Emotions\", and \"Tell No Lies\". \r\n\r\nSpoons was formed in Burlington, Ontario, in 1979. The band initially consisted of Gordon Deppe (lead vocals and guitar), Sandy Horne (vocals and bass), Brett Wickens (keyboards, synths), and Peter Shepherd (drums). Deppe, Horne, and Wickens attended Aldershot High School, and Deppe and Horne (the only constant members of the band) dated in high school.\r\n\r\nIn late 1979, Shepherd left the band and was replaced by Derrick Ross on drums. Spoons then released an independent single, \"After the Institution\", in 1980 on Mannequin Records, produced by the band and former member Shepherd. Shortly thereafter, Wickens left the band to release an electronica album as part of the duo Ceramic Hello, also on Mannequin Records, and later became a graphic designer designing album covers for such artists as Peter Gabriel. He was replaced by keyboardist Rob Preuss, who was only fifteen when he joined Spoons.","track-duration":"402000","track-name":"Nova Heart"}

Commonly nicknamed the \"Piano Man\", he has been making music since the 1960s, releasing popular albums throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1949 in The Bronx, New York, and grew up on Long Island, New York, both places that influenced his music. After dropping out of high school, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, The Hassles and Attila, before signing a record deal with Family Productions and kicking off a solo career in 1971 with his first release, Cold Spring Harbor. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of Columbia Records after a live radio performance of the song \"Captain Jack\" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second solo album, Piano Man, which contained his first hit single of the same name. After releasing two more albums, Streetlife Serenade and Turnstiles, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, The Stranger, in 1977; this album became Columbia's best-selling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including \"Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)\" and \"Just the Way You Are\".","track-duration":"206000","track-name":"Just The Way You Are"}

The band has gone through several phases; its strongest commercial success occurred between 1978 and 1987 when Steve Perry was lead vocalist. During that period, the band released a series of hit songs, including \"Don't Stop Believin'\" (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in iTunes history among songs not released in the 21st century. Its parent studio album, Escape, the band's seventh and most successful, reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and yielded another of their most popular singles, \"Open Arms\". Its 1983 follow-up album, Frontiers, was almost as successful in the United States, reaching No. 2 and spawning several successful singles; it broadened the band's appeal in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. Journey enjoyed a successful reunion in the mid-1990s and later regrouped with a series of lead singers.\r\n\r\nJourney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the class of 2017. Inductees included lead singer Steve Perry, guitarist Neal Schon, keyboardists Jonathan Cain and Gregg Rolie, bassist Ross Valory, and drummers Aynsley Dunbar and Steve Smith.","track-duration":"219000","track-name":"Any Way You Want It"}

The group came to prominence playing rhythm and blues music. They made some changes in musicians but settled on a line-up of Pinder, Thomas, Edge, guitarist Justin Hayward, and bassist John Lodge, who stayed together for most of the band's \"classic era\" into the early 1970s.\r\n\r\nTheir second album, Days of Future Passed, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music which established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\". The group toured extensively through the early 1970s, then took an extended hiatus from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left the group a year after they re-formed and was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1978. In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop sound and produced.\r\n\r\nThe Moody Blues' most successful singles include \"Go Now\", \"Nights in White Satin\", \"Tuesday Afternoon\", \"Question\", and \"Your Wildest Dreams\". The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide, which includes 18 platinum and gold LPs. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.","track-duration":"461000","track-name":"The Night: Nights In White Satin"}

The album features extended renderings of their songs \"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\", \"You Don't Love Me\" and \"Whipping Post\", and is often considered among the best live albums ever made.\r\n\r\nGroup leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year - on October 29, 1971, and the band dedicated Eat a Peach (1972) to his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg Allman's \"Melissa\" and Dickey Betts's \"Blue Sky\". Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley exactly one year and 13 days later on November 11, 1972, the group recruited keyboardist Chuck Leavell and bassist Lamar Williams for 1973's Brothers and Sisters. This album included Betts's hit single \"Ramblin' Man\". These tunes went on to become classic rock radio staples, and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.\r\n\r\nThe band reformed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist Oteil Burbridge and guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks (the nephew of their original drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's Beacon Theatre each spring. The band retired for good in 2014 with the departure of Haynes and Derek Trucks.\r\n\r\nButch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head on January 24, 2017, in West Palm Beach, Florida, at the age of 69. Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer on May 27, 2017. The band has been awarded seven gold and four platinum albums, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by the critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s,\" the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image.\r\n\r\nFormer art school students who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut album, Talking Heads: 77, to positive reviews in 1977. They collaborated with producer Brian Eno on a trio of experimental and critically acclaimed releases: More Songs About Buildings and Food (1978), Fear of Music (1979), and Remain in Light (1980). After a hiatus, Talking Heads hit their commercial peak in 1983 with the U.S. Top 10 hit \"Burning Down the House\" and released the concert film Stop Making Sense, directed by Jonathan Demme. They released several more albums, including their best-selling LP Little Creatures (1985), before disbanding in 1991.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Talking Heads were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Four of their albums appear in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and three of their songs (\"Psycho Killer\", \"Life During Wartime\", and \"Once in a Lifetime\") were included among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. Talking Heads were also number 64 on VH1's list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\". In the 2011 update of Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\", they were ranked number 100.","track-name":"Stop Making Sense (Girlfriend Is Better)","track-mbid":"1a6f61dc-c17f-4bc4-98e4-106608688a63","album-name":"The Observer","album-mbid":"66c399b8-e67f-4031-82d5-fec6251fc6b0","album-released":"1985","album-image":"https://coverartarchive.org/release/d2c2ce69-9c9e-4635-b900-74e59d348820/15351683170-250.jpg","album-label":"Palm Pictures"}

That session is then processed, and uploaded to archive.org for storage, and saved for history.\r\n\r\nIt is the way the group can continue to perform the music they love, and not have to deal with the extra work involved in being in a band (group). It provides the members with everything they seek in playing without having to deal with the rest of the bullshit that comes with jamming out in public.","track-name":"Dont Lie To Me","track-mbid":"cd5eb8da-5a53-4750-8d87-e87a03e6ee2b","album-name":"05-04-2019","album-mbid":"7fad0888-2de4-4712-be10-e49e46f1687d","album-released":"2019","album-image":"https://coverartarchive.org/release/7fad0888-2de4-4712-be10-e49e46f1687d/22955699904-250.jpg","album-label":"Toby Records"}
